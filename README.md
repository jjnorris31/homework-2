An app about me.

## Requirements

Create an app that describes you with the following parts:

1. Main activity
  * With a label and button.
  * In the label the user must write her name.
  * When the button is pressed the activity changes to a new one.

2. Menu activity
  * Shows a textview that says "HI " with the name of the user.
  * Shows an empty textview that will change later.
  * Shows 3 image buttons, each one will change the view:
     + My hobbies - show a picture of your hobby, a textview that says "what is your hobby?", an empty text field and a button. When the user presses the app returns to the menu now showing your hobby in the previously empty textview.
     + My Friends - show pictures of your friends
     + Leave a message - shows an empty text field and a "send" button. When the user sends the message a Toast shows "Message sent" and the app returns to the Menu activity.
